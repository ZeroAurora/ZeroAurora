- A high school student in Fujian, China.
- I often post useless issues/discussions.
- A [MUG (Music Game)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_video_game) and [Arknights](https://ak.hypergryph.com/) lover.
- I speak (Simplified) Chinese and English.
- I'm not a programmer. Currently. Maybe as well in the future.
